These books include the top ten teen favorites as well as books that have received literary acclaim. All books will be available to any student who wants to borrow and read them. They will also be used in Sustained Silent Reading time when students have time in class to read for fun as well.  ^M\n^M\nBy donating to this whole_project, you will give my students access to the newest books--books that are current, relevant, and fun in their eyes.
